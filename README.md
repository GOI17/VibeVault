- `npm run ios` - Run on iOS simulator
- `npm run web` - Run in web browser
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

## 🌐 Browser checks

- Use **cmux-browser** for visual/browser verification.
- Evidence and fallback rules live in [`docs/browser-workflow.md`](docs/browser-workflow.md).
- Legacy Playwright artifacts are read-only and should not be extended in this change context.
- Verify the policy with `npm run verify:browser-policy`.

### Phase 1 UI compliance harness

- Run `npm run verify:stitch-ui-updates-phase1` to check the 10 phase-1 shell and route invariants.
- `PASS` / exit code `0`: all scenarios matched the current UI shell policy.
- `FAIL` / exit code `1`: one or more scenarios drifted; inspect the failing scenario ids in stdout.
- `BLOCKED`: the harness does not depend on Playwright or a browser surface; use cmux-browser for visual validation instead.

### Verification output

- `PASS` / exit code `0`: the documented policy scenarios are present and consistent.
- `FAIL` / exit code `1`: one or more policy scenarios are missing.
- `BLOCKED`: cmux is unavailable; do not fall back to Playwright.
- Output labels: PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED.
