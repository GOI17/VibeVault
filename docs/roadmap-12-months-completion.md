## P1 — Core Tracking ✅

|---|---|---|
| Search catalog | ✅ | `containers/SearchContainer.tsx`, `components/views/SearchView.tsx` |
| Add favorite | ✅ | `hooks/useFavoriteMutations.ts` |

| Mark movie watched | ✅ | `hooks/useWatchedProgress.ts` |
| Manual favorites | ✅ | `components/forms/AddFavoriteForm.tsx` |
| Update progress | ✅ | `containers/DetailsContainer.tsx`, `containers/EpisodeListContainer.tsx` |

Polish completed:
- Empty states: `components/common/EmptyState.tsx`, `components/views/HomeView.tsx`,
  `components/views/FavoritesView.tsx`, `components/views/SearchView.tsx`,
  `components/views/EpisodeListView.tsx`, `components/views/PosterQueueView.tsx`.
- Search suggestions loading/error states with retry: `hooks/useSearchSuggestions.ts`,
  `components/navigation/SearchInputWithSuggestions.tsx`.
- PosterQueue accessibility labels: `components/views/PosterQueueView.tsx`.

## P2 — Shareability ✅

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Deep-link into details | ✅ | PR #77, `src/domain/utils/shareMedia.ts` |
| Streaming-platform deep links | ✅ | `components/premium/StreamingLinks.tsx`, `src/domain/entities/StreamingPlatform.ts` |

| Device-generated yearly rewind | ✅ | `components/premium/DeviceRewindCard.tsx`, `containers/RewindContainer.tsx`, `src/domain/utils/deviceRewind.ts` |

## P3 — Monetization ⏸️ (gated)

Per roadmap decision, monetization work starts only after **100+ WAU**.

Current state:
- Premium subscription scaffolding: ✅ (`src/domain/entities/Subscription.ts`, `src/repositories/LocalSubscriptionRepository.ts`, `src/providers/SubscriptionProvider.tsx`).
- Premium-gated streaming deep links: ✅ (`components/premium/PremiumGate.tsx`, `components/views/DetailsView.tsx`).
- Real payment integration: ⏸️ deferred until WAU threshold.
- Notifications: ⏸️ deferred until WAU threshold.
- Unlimited export: partially available via local export; premium-gated logic deferred.

## P4 — Publishing Platform 🚧 (backend scaffolding)

Backend scaffolding implemented in `backend/`.

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Server + CORS | ✅ | `backend/src/server.js` |
| SQLite schema | ✅ | `backend/src/schema.sql` |
| Migrations | ✅ | `backend/src/migrate.js` |
| JWT auth + Google login link | ✅ | `backend/src/jwt.js`, `backend/src/google.js`, `POST /api/auth/google` |
| Public profile endpoints | ✅ | `GET /api/u/:handle`, `GET/PUT /api/me/profile` |
| Public list endpoints | ✅ | `GET /api/lists/:id`, CRUD `/api/me/lists`, `GET /api/u/:handle/lists` |
| Published rewind endpoints | ✅ | `POST/GET /api/me/rewinds/:year`, `GET /api/rewind/:handle/:year` |
| Client contracts/adapters | ⏸️ deferred | Needs `src/domain` contracts + repository adapter |
| UI for publish/public views | ⏸️ deferred | Expo screens not yet built |
| Deployment/hosting | ⏸️ deferred | Local SQLite file; choose hosting before production |

## P5 — Social Network 🚧 (planned)

Backend data model and endpoints in place; client UI deferred.

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Follows table | ✅ | `backend/src/schema.sql` (`follows`) |
| Activities table | ✅ | `backend/src/schema.sql` (`activities`) |
| Follow/unfollow endpoints | ✅ | `POST/DELETE /api/me/follows/:handle` |
| Followers/following lists | ✅ | `GET /api/u/:handle/followers`, `GET /api/u/:handle/following` |
| Activity feed | ✅ | `GET /api/me/feed` |
| Client social UI | ⏸️ deferred | Needs P4 validation first |

## Decision log applied

1. No backend in P0-P2: ✅ kept.
2. Monetization is P3, not P0: ✅ kept; payment integration gated.
3. Social ≠ publishing: ✅ documented as deferred.
4. Rewind is device-generated: ✅ implemented without public URLs.
5. Premium features are convenience, not lock-in: ✅ core tracking remains free.

## Verification

- `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` ✅
- `./node_modules/.bin/eslint` on touched scope ✅
